🚆 Railway Ticket Booking System

Problem Statement:
You are tasked with creating a simple railway ticket booking system for a fictional railway company called CodeRail. The system should ask users for their age, travel class, and whether they want a meal included. Based on this input, the system will calculate and display the total ticket price.

🎯 Requirements:

1. Ask the user for their name and age.
2. Ask them to choose a class:

⿡ First Class – ₹1500
⿢ Second Class – ₹1000
⿣ Sleeper Class – ₹500

3. If the passenger is under 5 years old, the ticket is free.

4. If the passenger is a senior citizen (60+), apply a 20% discount.


5. Ask if they want to add a meal:

Yes – ₹200 extra

No – No extra charge




6. Finally, print the passenger details and the final ticket price.
